🏠 Loan Status PredictionThis project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict loan approval status based on various applicant features. The model is built using Python, leveraging popular data science libraries like pandas, numpy, seaborn, and scikit-learn.📊 DatasetThe dataset used for this project is train_u6lujuX_CVtuZ9i (1).csv, which contains information about loan applicants, including their demographics, income, loan amount, credit history, and the final loan status (approved or not approved).✨ FeaturesData Loading and Inspection: Loads the dataset into a pandas DataFrame and provides initial insights into its structure and content.Missing Value Handling: Identifies and handles missing values by dropping rows with NaN entries.Categorical to Numerical Conversion: Transforms categorical features (Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self_Employed, Property_Area, Loan_Status) into numerical representations using label encoding and direct replacement for better model compatibility.Data Splitting: Divides the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.Model Training: Trains an SVM classifier with a linear kernel on the preprocessed training data.Accuracy Evaluation: Assesses the model's performance by calculating accuracy scores on both the training and test datasets.🛠️ Technologies UsedPythonpandas: For data manipulation and analysis.numpy: For numerical operations.seaborn: For data visualization (specifically, count plots for exploratory analysis).scikit-learn: For machine learning, including SVM and accuracy metrics.🚀 Getting StartedTo run this project, ensure you have Python installed and the necessary libraries.InstallationClone the repository (if applicable):git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
Install the required Python packages:pip install pandas numpy seaborn scikit-learn
UsagePlace the dataset: Make sure the train_u6lujuX_CVtuZ9i (1).csv file is in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook (Loan_Status.ipynb).Run the Jupyter Notebook: Open and run the Loan_Status.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment (e.g., Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab).The notebook will:Load and preprocess the data.Train the SVM model.Print the accuracy scores on the training and test datasets.📈 ResultsThe notebook outputs the accuracy of the SVM model on both the training and test datasets. For instance, the provided notebook snippet shows:Accuracy on training data: 0.7986 (approximately 79.86%)Accuracy on test data: 0.8333 (approximately 83.33%)This indicates that the model generalizes reasonably well to unseen data.🧑‍💻 ContributingFeel free to fork this repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests.
